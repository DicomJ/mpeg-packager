__Unfortunatly__ :cry: I don't have resources (especially time) to sustain this project, as well as to evolve other projects like [MPEG-ISOBASE](https://github.com/DicomJ/mpeg-isobase) and [MPEG-PROFILER](https://github.com/DicomJ/mpeg-profiler) even though theirs readiness is around 95%.

But if by chance you would like __to invest into Just In Time Packaging (JITP) primarily on the Edge__ with server-side ad insertion/stitching, DRM and forensic watermarking or least get me well-paid regular job, working on applications of [MPEG-ISOBASE](https://github.com/DicomJ/mpeg-isobase) and/or [MPEG-PROFILER](https://github.com/DicomJ/mpeg-profiler) libraries or any multimedia streaming applications which require leveraging of similar technics developed by me in these libraries, please don't hesitate to reach out to me by email: DicomJ23@Gmail.com.
