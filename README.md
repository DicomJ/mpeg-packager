__Unfortunatly__ I don't have resources (especially time) to sustain this project, as well as to evolve other projects like [MPEG-ISOBASE](https://github.com/DicomJ/mpeg-isobase) and [MPEG-PROFILER](https://github.com/DicomJ/mpeg-profiler) even though theirs readiness is around 95%.

But if by chance you would like __to invest into Just In Time Packaging (JITP) primarily on the Edge__ with server-side ad insertion/stitching, DRM and forensic watermarking, please don't hesitate to reach out to me by email: DicomJ23@Gmail.com.
